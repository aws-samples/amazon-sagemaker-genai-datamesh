## Modern Data Architectures with Large Language Models

This repository provides the source code for use cases where applications interact with Large Language Model (LLM) using Langchain framework and text to SQL.
There are two modes demonstrated here:
Mode 1 - Use of LLMs with Langchain via Amazon Sagemaker Jumpstart.  Amazon Sagemaker Jumpstart makes it simple to host LLMs as Sagemaker Endpoints enabling uses-cases for inference and embeddings generation.
Mode 2 - Bring your own model api. In this case, provide API keys of your LLM to the Langchain framework.
